
Hash-function -> takes the key and converts it into array-index.

Issues :
	- computing the hash function (i.e. an ideal hash function, to uniformly distribute the key index)
	- equality test : method for checking whether two keys are equal.
	- collision resolution - algo and data structure to handle two keys that hash to same array index.
	
Classic space-time tradeoff.
	- No space limitation: trivial hash function with key as index.
	- No time limitation: trivial collision resolution with sequential search.
	- Space and time limitations: hashing (the real world).
	
implementaiton of hash function
===============================

goal : scramble the keys uniformly to produce a table index so that ---
		- req #1 : effeciently computable
		- req #2 : each table (array) index is equally likely for each key.
		
ex 1  : say you wantto save phone numbers, which part of daya you will inject ot hash function ?
		Bad : first three digits
		Better : last three digits 
Ex 2 : Aadhar numbers :
		Bad : first three digits
		Better : last three digits
	
	jest : Need diff approach for dofferent keys. 
	
Java Hash code conventions
===========================

All Java classes inherit a method hashCode(), which returns a 32-bit int.

Requirement. If x.equals(y), then (x.hashCode() == y.hashCode()).

Highly desirable. If !x.equals(y), then (x.hashCode() != y.hashCode()).

	- Default implementation. Memory address of x.
	- Legal (but poor, fails req #2 above) implementation. Always return 17.
	- Customized implementations. Integer, Double, String, File, URL, Date, …
	- User-defined types. Users are on their own.
	
	Strings -> Horners method is used to hash string of lenght L
	
	- if your object is immutable (like string), hash will return same value everytime you call obj.hashcode().
	- so for optimization, save the hashcode value as private instance variable and return the same value
		for obj.hashcode() call. This sill save calculation of hashcode everytime.
