Graph terminology
====================

Path. Sequence of vertices connected by edges.
Cycle. Path whose first and last vertices are the same.

Two vertices are connected if there is a path between them.

Some graph-process problems ?
==============================


Path. 
=====

Is there a path between s and t ?
Shortest path. What is the shortest path between s and t ?

Cycle. 
======
Is there a cycle in the graph?
Euler tour. Is there a cycle that uses each "edge" exactly once?
Hamilton tour. Is there a cycle that uses each "vertex" exactly once.

Connectivity. 
=============
Is there a way to connect all of the vertices?
MST. (minimum spaning tree) What is the best way to connect all of the vertices?
Biconnectivity. Is there a vertex whose removal disconnects the graph?

Planarity. 
==========
Can you draw the graph in the plane with no crossing edges
Graph isomorphism. Do two adjacency lists represent the same graph?
