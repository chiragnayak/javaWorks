stratgey -> (Put 'new/starting' element v on queue)
 
 BFS (from source vertex s)
 
Put s onto a FIFO queue, and mark s as visited.
Repeat until the queue is empty:
- remove the least recently added vertex v (front of queue)
- add each of v's unvisited neighbors to the queue (end of queue), and mark them as visited.
 	
 
 Properties:
 ===========
 
 - puts unvitied elements (vertices) to queue and processes it 
 - path we get from BFS is the one which uses fewest number of edges (shortest path)
 
 - BFS examins vertices in the graph in increasing distance from source
