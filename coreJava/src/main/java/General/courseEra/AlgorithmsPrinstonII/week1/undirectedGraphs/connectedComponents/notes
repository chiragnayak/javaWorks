Def. Vertices v and w are connected if there is a path between them.
Goal. Preprocess graph to answer queries of the form is v connected to w in constant time.

The relation "is connected to" is an equivalence relation:
  -> Reflexive: v is connected to v.
  -> Symmetric: if v is connected to w, then w is connected to v.
  -> Transitive: if v connected to w and w connected to x, then v connected to x.
  
Def. A connected component is a maximal set of connected vertices.

how to achieve ?

Goal. Partition vertices into connected components. (using id[])

Connected components 
-> Initialize all vertices v as unmarked.
-> For each unmarked vertex v, run DFS to identify all vertices discovered as part of the same component.
