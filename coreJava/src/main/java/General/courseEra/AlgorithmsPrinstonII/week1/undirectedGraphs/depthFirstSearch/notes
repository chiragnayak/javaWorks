How to ?

To visit a vertex v :
		-- Mark vertex v as visited.
		-- Recursively visit all unmarked vertices adjacent to v.

(puts un-visited element on to stack and process it)

Properties
==========

DFS marks all vertices connected to s in time proportional to the sum of their degrees.


--- If w marked, then w connected to s

Explanation : If you have marked vertex w (i.e. marked[w] is set to true), it means that vertex-w is connected to vertex-s (by recursive calls), using some path.

--- anaother inference, if w connected to s, then w marked. 

--- On contrary, if vertex-w unmarked, then there will be an edge from vertex-s towards vertex-w, that is not connected (un-marked)


Each vertex connected to s is visited once.

After DFS, one can find vertices connected to s in constant time and can find a path to s (if one exists) in time proportional to its length.
