
Composing Object Principle
===========================

This principle states that classes should achieve code reuse through aggregation rather than inheritance. 

Design patterns, such as the composite design pattern and decorator design pattern use this design principle.

Composing objects principle will :

	(1) provide a means of code reuse without the tight coupling of inheritance. 
	
	(2) Allow objects to dynamically add behaviors at run time 
	
	(3) provide your system with more flexibility.
