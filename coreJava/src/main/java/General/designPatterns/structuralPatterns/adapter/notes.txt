
-> Allows two incompatible interfaces to work together.

-> Used when client expects "Target" interface. But we have Adaptee (available) to our disposal.

-> Adapter class allows the use of the "Available" interface and the "Target" interface

	 Object Adapter Vs Class Adapter
	 ===============================
	
	The adapter pattern in which the adapter holds an instance of adaptee is Object Adapter Pattern. Hence based on object composition.
	
	There is also another type called Class Adapter Pattern which use inheritance instead of composition but you require multiple inheritance to implement it.
