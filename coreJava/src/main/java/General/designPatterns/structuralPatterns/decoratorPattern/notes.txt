
allows to modify an object dynamically

The intent of this pattern is to add additional responsibilities dynamically to an object.

we use it when we want :
	-> capabilities of inheritance with subclasses
	-> but we need to add functionalities at runtime
	
we add functionality using simple classes

-> "rather rewrite the old code, you can extend to new code"

intent -> Extending an objects functionality can be done statically (at compile time) by using inheritance 
however it might be necessary to extend an objects	functionality dynamically (at runtime) as an object is used.
