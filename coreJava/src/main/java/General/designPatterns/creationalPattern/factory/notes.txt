
Factory(Simplified version of Factory Method) 

- Creates objects without exposing the instantiation logic to the client 
- Refers to the newly created object through a common interface.



         Client 
         	--> Client : Asks for concrete object from factory 
         	--> factory : createObjects() and returns
         	--> client : access the object using the interface/abstract class reference.
