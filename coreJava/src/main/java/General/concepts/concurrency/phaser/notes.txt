
-> To participate in the coordination, the thread needs to register() itself with the Phaser instance.

-> The thread signals that it arrived at the barrier by calling the arriveAndAwaitAdvance(), which is a blocking method.

IMP : -> When the number of arrived parties is equal to the number of registered parties, the execution of the program will continue, and the phase number will increase. 

-> We can get the current phase number by calling the getPhase() method.

-> When the thread finishes its job, we should call the arriveAndDeregister() method to signal that the current thread should no longer be accounted for in this particular phase.
