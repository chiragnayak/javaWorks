

map(), 

	-> performs functional operation (it is intermediate operations)
	-> it applies a function on each element of stream and stores the value returned by the function into a new Stream. 
	-> This way one stream is transformed into another. 

the function used for transformation in map() returns a single value.

But, if map() uses a function, which, instead of returning a single value returns a Stream of values than you have a Stream of Stream of values, 

	-> then a flatmap() is used to flat that into a (single) Stream of values.
	-> it is combination of a map and a flat operation
