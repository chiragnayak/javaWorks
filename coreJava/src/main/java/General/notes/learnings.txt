
to fetch binary
===============
loop --
 	val = num%2 -> will give 1 or 0.
 	num /= 2 -> next iteration input.
 
 
 
 you will have to reverse it before printing.
 
 
 fetch individual digits:
 =======================
 loop --
 	val = num % 10 -> gives last digit.
 	num = num / 10 -> truncates last digit
 	
 If processing string or content of string []
 ============================================= 
 
 check : 
 	it is not null
 	it is not empty
 	
 
 Golden rule (to cover use cases) :
 Put conditions, using which the answer can be directly deduced or further processing can be averted.
 	like > if the divisor is 1, answer will be dividend, directly return it
 		 > if the range is out-of-bounds (specifically for in cases), process it before doing any calculations on it
 	     > if string is empty > return directly without any further processing
