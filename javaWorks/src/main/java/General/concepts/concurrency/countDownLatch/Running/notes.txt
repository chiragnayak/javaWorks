CountDownLatch
===============

When you create a CountDownLatch, you initialize it with an integer, which represents a count value. 

Threads would wait (by calling the await() method) for this count to reach zero. 

Once zero is reached, all threads are released; any other calls to await() would return immediately since the count is already zero.

The counter value can be decremented by one by calling the countDown() method. 

You can get the current value of the counter using the getCount() method.
