Interface Segregation principle
================================

states that :

This design principle states that a class should not be forced to depend on methods it does not use, 
and 
interfaces should be split up in such a way that it can properly describe the separate functionalities of your system. 

Meaning: Any class that implements an interface, should not have "dummy" implementations of any methods defined in the interface.
		 Instead, you should split large interfaces into smaller generalizations (interfaces).
